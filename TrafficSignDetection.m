    % TrafficSignDetection
    % Perform detection of Traffic signs on images. Detection is performed first at the pixel level
    % using a color segmentation. Then, using the color segmentation as a basis, the most likely window 
    % candidates to contain a traffic sign are selected using basic features (form factor, filling factor). 
    % Finally, a decision is taken on these windows using geometric heuristics (Hough) or template matching.
